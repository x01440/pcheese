 * HOWEVER, on occasion WooCommerce will need to update template files and you
 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.

   <em>The Pinconning Cheese Co. is dedicated to offering fresh, cut-to-order cheeses, meats and fudge. 
     It is impossible to cut exactly one pound every time. 
     In order to calculate your order accurately, we initially charge each pound as 1.33 pounds. 
     Once we cut and weigh your order, the final price will be rounded down to reflect the actual weight of your product. 
     You will always be charged only for the exact amount you receive; 
     this price will be reflected on your final invoice.<br>
